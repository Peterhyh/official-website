                Hi there! My name is Peter Huynh and I graduated the backend and full stack programs
                at Nucamp with honors. I have a great passion for coding and ready to put my skills to
                the test in a professional setting. I also enjoy photography, automotives, 3D printing,
                and building gaming PC's. I love figuring out how something works and being able to
                replicate/build it myself and eventually make it better than the original. My favorite part
                about the process is discovering an original idea of my own along the way.
